# Does-it-Stand-
Hackprinceton Spring 2023 Project 
# Inspiration
After the unfortunate natural disaster that happened recently in Turkey & Syria, We have realized that there might be a solution to help save people's lives proactively. A wise man once said, a shaking ground can never take away a life, but a falling glass will..

Using that Principle we aimed to filter buildings using proven historical data to determine what buildings are at risk and what buildings are relatively safer.

# What it does
Does it stand takes in various data from history such as the locations of the earthquakes, age of the building, and concentration of cement in the building. From there it analyzes data to determine if a building has a chance of standing against an earthquake.

# How we built it
We have used Artificial Neural Networks for the brain of the model.

Verbwire to be our storage handler ( saving and retrieving file data from the blockchain )

Flask for the Backend

Bootstrap to add simplistic styling for the front end

# Challenges we ran into
Data Availability, Unfortunately, most of the data needed wasn't available online easily. So what we have done was that we made a mock of data for the prototype to prove the idea and its concept.

# Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are helping humans!!! We believe that this is the main in our project, helping the less fortunate.

# What we learned
Time management is always the first thing we have adapted to.

Researching skills ( A lot of heavy research was involved to make a mockup data for the project)

# What's next for Does it Stand?
we are really excited to see what feedback we get from the judges so that we can improve our idea better.

One main idea we want to implement:

A CNN model takes in the blueprints of the buildings and integrates them with the main ANN model creating a good Hyper model to have better efficiency and accuracy.
